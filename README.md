# Do Whatever Code of Conduct

A non-restrictive Code of Conduct.

## Why?

Because stuff like [Open Code of Conduct](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct) is a bit too suppresive
and restrictive.

## What does this CoC do?

Anything. Everything. It defines that people can act however they please, but are subject to any consequences that
may incur. 
That is only fair.

## License

WTFPL v2

## Contributing?

Great! Submit a PR and I will probably close it (shouldn't be restricting). That being said, if it's to improve terms or anything really, open it.
I'm greatful for anything!
