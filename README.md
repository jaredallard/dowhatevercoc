# Do Whatever Code of Conduct

A non-restrictive Code of Conduct.

## Why?

Because stuff like [Open Code of Conduct](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct) is a bit too suppresive
and restrictive.

## What does this CoC do?

Anything. Everything. It defines that people can act however they please, but are required to take responsibility for any consequences which arise from their actions. 
That is only fair.

## License

WTFPL v2

## Contributing?

Great! Submit a PR and I will probably close it (shouldn't be restricting). That being said, if it's to improve terms or anything really, open it.
I'm grateful for anything!
