# Do Whatever Code of Conduct
The Do Whatever Code of Conduct / a fair CoC


## Why?

Because stuff like [Open Code of Conduct](link) is a bit to supressing on people.

## What does this CoC do?

Anything. Everything. It defines that people can act however the please, but are subject to consequences to their actions.
That is only fair.

## License

WTFPL v3 (or greater)

## Contributing?

Great! Submit a PR and I will probably close it (shouldn't be restricting). That being said, if it's to improve terms or anything really, open it.
I'm greatful for anything!
